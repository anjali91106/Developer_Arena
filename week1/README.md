# John Smith - Web Developer Portfolio

A professional, semantic HTML5 portfolio website showcasing my journey as a beginner web developer. This project demonstrates my understanding of HTML5 fundamentals, semantic markup, and web accessibility best practices.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This portfolio website serves as my digital business card and learning showcase. Built entirely with HTML5 (no CSS yet, as I'm focusing on mastering HTML fundamentals first), it demonstrates:

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Accessibility best practices
- Form validation
- Internal navigation
- Professional content organization

## 🚀 Features

### Core Sections
- **Header**: Personal branding with navigation menu
- **About**: Professional introduction with profile image
- **Skills**: Technical competencies and learning progress
- **Projects**: Showcase of beginner-level work
- **Contact**: Validated contact form and social links
- **Footer**: Copyright information and secondary navigation

### Technical Implementation
- Semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Internal anchor navigation
- Form validation with HTML5 attributes
- Accessibility features (alt text, labels, semantic structure)
- Meta tags for SEO
